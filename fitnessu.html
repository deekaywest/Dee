        There are many workout apps available in the iTunes app store, but none are specifically for college students. This app is tailored to fit the needs of college students while being personalized down to their specific university gym. Our goal for creating this app was to take the anxiety out of going to the gym. Now a student will have the whole gym available at their fingertips. No longer will they have to wander around looking for equipment, or trying to load youtube workout videos on their phone. Everything is in one place. Whether the user is a new student, a student that has never been to the gym, or a student that goes everyday, there is something helpful to everyone on this app. We found through usability testing that students were able to easily navigate the app and completed task on the first try in a timely manner. Throughout multiple rounds of testing within the design process, the ideation of the app became more concise and simple. We hope that the final product shows the love we have for fitness and wanting to share that with other students everywhere.
