        College students going to JMU are facing a major transportation problem. Buses donâ€™t run at the proper times or travel to the correct, specific locations a student may need. Mainstream ridesharing solutions like Uber and Lyft have a growing reputation of unsafe conditions and high prices. People are actively looking for convenient and timely ways to travel around the Harrisonburg area.
        <br>
        <br>
        JMU RideShare wants to provide JMU students in the Harrisonburg area an effective way to have access to different ridesharing options. We plan to target undergraduate students, graduate students, and transfer students with a way to either rideshare, rent a car, or work as a driver for our company.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using the JMU RideShare website and mobile app, users will be able to connect with independent drivers who are willing to provide ridesharing services. Furthermore, JMU RideShare will provide rental cars that users can rent from our site to use on an hourly and mileage basis.
        <br>
        <br>
        To carry out the tasks described in this summary, JMU RideShare will outsource our marketing and social media management to external sources, cutting down on costs, and actively work to partner with JMU to create a community that is willing to come together and create a ridesharing family.
