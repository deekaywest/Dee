        The Harrisonburg Rockingham Historical Society (HRHS) was founded in 1897 (HRHS
Our History, n.d.). At that time, the society was not involved in collecting items or preserving
them for a museum setting. During this period, the HRHS was more concerned with recording
documents about the area’s history. Everything from political achievements to influential local
news stories were recorded.
        <br>
        <br>
 Once the museum was introduced in 1933, it moved around quite a bit before it found its
permanent location in Dayton, VA. It was first located inside of the Main Street Elementary
School on South Main Street in Harrisonburg. Then its first move came in 1978 when it
temporarily resided in the building that is now the Quilt Museum, again on South Main Street. It
was then moved to its current home, Dayton, in 1988 (HRHS Our History, n.d.). In 1993, a new
complex was built to house the museum and in 1999 the expansion was complete. This was
made possible by the funding that came from the Margaret Grattan Weaver Foundation. Thanks
to this renovation and expansion, the museum is now over 7,000 square feet in size (HRHS Our
History, n.d.). The museum owes its growth to the fund drives and donations and the
organization is clear to point that out on the website. Because of several fund drives, they have
established an endowment fund and use this to help account for operating expenses (HRHS “Our
History”, n.d.).
        <br>
        <br>
 Currently, the museum has been operating for over 100 years. They boast an incredible
selection of written documents, as well as photographs and artifacts of the history of the local
area. They have a current exhibit that changes every now and then to attract more people and
keep the atmosphere at the museum fresh. The HRHS is one of the only societies to focus on 
preserving the local history of Rockingham county and they are incredibly dedicated to doing it
well.
        <br>

The museum operates under a lot of worker’s attention to detail. Penny Imeson is the
only full time employee at the moment. She let us know that the museum also has an
administrator, who is currently only part time. There is a manager who works there as well,
however only on the weekends (Penny Imeson, personal communication, Nov 2, 2019). The
museum owes a lot to its sixty volunteers; they work around the clock to make sure that the
exhibits are in top shape, and the museum can run smoothly. Penny placed a lot of emphasis on
these volunteers and the work that they do. This kind of community involvement to
understanding local history is what will be emphasized through this campaign.
        <br>
        <br>
Competition for the Heritage Museum is pretty relevant in terms of actual local business
competitors. The Massanutten Resort and mountain provide a decent amount of competition
(Penny Imeson, personal communication, Nov 2, 2019). The museum relies on people who have
an interest in their local community. The resort can distract people from this, giving them options
to ski, hike, or stay in hotels creates a lot of distraction for locals, as well as for tourists who
might be stopping by the area. It can be hard to outshine such a large business. Other museums
also come into play; The Quilt Museum, Frontier Culture, and The Historical Society in
Bridgewater are among them. This campaign will help the Heritage Museum stand out against
these others as the place to go to learn, and to have a good time doing it. Another factor in
competition, is the presence of television and the internet. These entities are clearly the most
convenient way of getting quick entertainment in modern times. In order to attract people away
from their phones and televisions, the campaign will have to counteract the effects of media by 
using them to its advantage. This will attract a younger audience, and will lessen the effects of
the internet.
