        Thank you for the opportunity to reach out to your company in the interest of starting my career path with you all. I am a senior at James Madison University. I think I would be a great fit and a great asset to your company because I have gained valuable knowledge from my academic work here at James Madison. I am a Media Arts and Design Major with a concentration in Interactive Design. Interactive Design has not only taught me how to express myself creatively, but how to channel that creativity into what is right for the end user. Many of my classes consist of user research techniques and designing for the end user. When I don’t know a topic, then I know how to do research to better understand that topic.

        I don’t have the traditional Business degree. I am a Media Arts and Design major with a double minor in General Business and Communications. Because my background is in interactive design, I have been taught how to best solve problems and look good while doing it. It isn’t enough just to solve a problem. You need the research to support it, ways to develop it, and then make it presentable in a way that everyone can understand. User experience research and design has taught me all of these skills. Paired with my business and communications minors I am able to take a project from start to finish. 
        
        Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you all.
