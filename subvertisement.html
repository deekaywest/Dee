        The original ad depicts a black man throwing an afrod head. “Re-Civilize Yourself” is written across him. The ad gives the impression that it is uncivilized to have an afro and African Americans who don’t “tame” their hair or “look like they give a damn” are barbaric. We changed the ad to call out what society deems wrong: natural African American hair. African American men and women should be able to wear their hair in its natural state. They shouldn't have to hide it, straighten it, or completely cut it off to be accepted as professional or acceptable in today’s society. No one should be judged for the way they look, especially when it comes to things a person can not control. We replaced the head of the man with a ball and chain to demonstrate how the man in the image is trying to throw away society’s oppressive weight on him. It’s not one person’s responsibility to change how they are to fit into the white, clean-cut, male mold. It is society’s responsibility to open minds and stop oppressing minorities. This is why we changed the word  “look” to “act.” The problem isn't the way someone appears, but how society decides to act towards them. We crossed out “re” in “Re-Civilize” because society has never had a time without racial violence. We have made progress towards goals, but the fight for equal rights for everyone is nowhere near close to being over.
