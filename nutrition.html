        In this project, I learned about all the research that goes into what is needed to design a product. You cant just start designing anything because if people aren't going to use it or don't know how to use it then it is pointless. I didn't realize how much research was involved in designing and this project has given me a new found appreciation for those who do it on a daily basis. I actually really enjoyed conducting the interviews. At first my questions weren't specific enough or clear. But once they were altered I was able to get results. Moving on to making the persona was fun. It was research but it was also a way to showcase my creativity and really become someone else. I am excited to be able to go back and add more design skills into my overall project. Right now it is just based on a simple word template that i altered a little. Being able to add my own personal touch is what will really wrap everything up nicely. The nutrition label to demonstrate my survey results was a fun creative design touch that I was able to insert into the project.

        The User Story Grid compared two aspects of users through their level of social activity and health consciousness. Within that scale I thought about what the user would ask and need to know about the app based on the type of person they are according to the two aspects. I then moved on to create three value propositions. These were used to really describe what the app should be doing for the user and why it benefits them. After the value propositions, I moved to making user stories. The user stories help identify exactly what the user wants from the app and why. Lastly, I was able to come up with user narratives. The Narratives were broken down into two parts, a problem and a solution. The problem scenarios represented a screenshot of that person's life without the app. The solution came about with how the app could help the person solve their already stated problem giving real world experience to the creation of the app.
